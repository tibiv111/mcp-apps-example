# NAV AI — Mock MCP Apps server

A FastAPI app that implements an [MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/) (SEP-1865) server with an interactive iframe UI, live SSE progress, and a mocked OAuth flow — everything needed to test the MCP Apps surface in Claude end-to-end without standing up real auth or persistence.

## What you get

- `POST /mcp` — JSON-RPC 2.0 MCP endpoint (initialize, tools/*, resources/*, ping).
- `GET  /mcp` — **server → client SSE channel** for JSON-RPC notifications (`notifications/resources/updated`, etc.). Open by the host's MCP client; the server pushes onto it whenever the shell changes.
- `ui://nav-ai/shell` — a polished single-page workspace served as an MCP App UI resource. Five views (launcher, dashboard, pricing form, forecast, catalog) with internal navigation. Adapts to host theme variables.
- `POST /oauth/*` + discovery — mock OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration.
- `GET /jobs/{id}/events` — direct SSE channel from the iframe for high-frequency forecast progress, bypassing MCP.
- `GET /shell/events` — second iframe-direct SSE channel for **server-pushed shell mutations** (banner changes etc.).
- `GET /ui/shell` — same HTML in a regular browser tab for visual checks.
- `GET /diagnostics` — **live trace timeline** of every MCP request, tool call, SSE event and postMessage notification, colour-coded by layer. Open this in a second tab while demoing; everything else lights up in real time.
- `GET /admin` — operator console for pushing shell updates (banner) to every connected client.

Tools:

| Tool | UI? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `launch_nav_ai` | ✓ | Opens the workspace iframe |
| `submit_pricing_change` | – | Called from the iframe's form view |
| `start_forecast` | – | Called from the iframe; spawns a background job |
| `lookup_product` | – | Forwards to a separate backend MCP using the same OAuth token |
| `discuss_selection` | – | **Bidirectional path** — called *from* the iframe with a selection (forecast result, pricing receipt, catalog entry). Returns a payload addressed to the model so the host (Claude) replies in the chat thread without the user typing anything. |

**Adding a new tool**: append a definition to `app/schemas.py:TOOLS`, write a handler in `app/mcp/tools.py`, register it in `TOOL_HANDLERS`. The dispatcher needs no changes.

## Three things the demo proves at runtime

These are the moments that distinguish a working MCP Apps implementation from a regular tool-result app. Open `/diagnostics` in a second tab while doing any of them — every layer lights up on the timeline.

### 1. Iframe → host model (bidirectional)

Run a forecast, then click **Discuss this forecast with Claude** on the result panel. The iframe calls `discuss_selection` over `tools/call`. The tool response is text written *to* the model, and Claude replies in the chat thread — even though the user never typed anything. Same pattern is wired into the pricing receipt and catalog views.

### 2. Server-pushed resource updates

Open `/admin` and broadcast a banner. The server (a) sends `notifications/resources/updated` for `ui://nav-ai/shell` over every open `GET /mcp` SSE listener (the spec path — host re-reads the resource) and (b) pushes the same fact straight into every open iframe via `/shell/events` (the always-works path — the banner appears immediately regardless of host behaviour). The header's `rev N` counter ticks up on every update. Capabilities advertised in `initialize`:

```json
"resources": { "listChanged": true, "subscribe": true }
```

### 3. Live cross-layer diagnostics

`/diagnostics` subscribes to an in-process trace bus that every layer publishes onto:

- `mcp` — `POST /mcp` request/response, `GET /mcp` listener open/close, broadcast notifications
- `tool` — each tool handler firing, with `duration_ms`
- `jobs` — forecast pipeline create / progress / done
- `sse` — iframe `/jobs/{id}/events` and `/shell/events` subscribe / push / unsubscribe
- `resource` — `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe`
- `admin` — banner mutations
- `ui` — iframe-side notes via `POST /diagnostics/note`

Click a correlation-id chip to highlight all events from the same request or job.

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/ui/shell> for the visual preview. Tool buttons will no-op (no MCP host parent listening) but navigation works.

## Deploy to Render

`render.yaml` declares **two services** — the frontend (what Claude talks to) and the backend (called by `lookup_product`). They can also run as one process if you don't set the cross-service env vars.

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. In Render: **New +** → **Blueprint** → pick the repo. Render reads `render.yaml` and provisions both services.
3. After the first deploy completes and Render assigns URLs, set the cross-service env vars (all `sync: false`, so Render asks you to fill them):

   **On `nav-ai-mock-mcp` (frontend):**
   - `BASE_URL` → this service's URL, e.g. `https://nav-ai-mock-mcp.onrender.com`. Required: without it the iframe's `<link>`/`<script>` and SSE calls all point at `localhost` and break inside Claude.
   - `BACKEND_URL` → the backend service's URL, e.g. `https://nav-ai-mock-backend.onrender.com`. Required for split deploys: without it, `lookup_product` calls `/backend/mcp` on the frontend itself (combined-mode default) instead of the backend service.

   **On `nav-ai-mock-backend`:**
   - `FRONTEND_URL` → the frontend service's URL. Required: the backend uses `{FRONTEND_URL}/oauth/introspect` (RFC 7662) to validate bearer tokens. Without it the backend rejects every request, since it has no shared state with the frontend.

4. Trigger redeploys after setting env vars.
5. Your MCP endpoint is `https://<frontend>.onrender.com/mcp`.

### Combined mode (single service)

To run as one process, deploy only the frontend service (delete the backend section from `render.yaml`, or just don't set `BACKEND_URL` / `FRONTEND_URL`). The frontend's own `/backend/mcp` route serves the backend role, and bearer tokens are validated in-memory against `state.issued_tokens`. The whole demo still works — fewer moving parts, but you lose the architectural realism of two separate services.

> Free tier sleeps after 15 min idle; first request takes ~30 sec to wake. With the split deploy you pay this cold start twice (frontend, then backend) on the first `lookup_product` call after idle.

## Connect from Claude

claude.ai → **Settings** → **Connectors** → **Add custom connector**:

- **Name:** NAV AI Mock
- **URL:** `https://<your-app>.onrender.com/mcp` ← don't forget `/mcp`

Click **Connect**. Claude will run the OAuth flow against the mock (which auto-accepts), then the connector is live.

In a new chat, enable the connector and try:

> Launch NAV AI

The launcher iframe should render inline. From there:
- Click **Open pricing**, fill in a product and price, hit Submit → ticket comes back.
- Click **Open forecast**, pick a region, hit Start → progress bar streams over SSE, final result panel renders.

              iframe (ui://nav-ai/shell)
              postMessage ↔ Claude (JSON-RPC over postMessage)
```

Two communication channels deliberately:

1. **iframe ⇄ Claude (postMessage):** JSON-RPC 2.0. Form submits and forecast-starts go this way so Claude sees them, can comment on results, and keeps the chat thread coherent.
2. **iframe ⇄ server (SSE direct):** for high-frequency progress updates that should not enter the model's context window. Allowed by `_meta.ui.csp.connectDomains` on the UI resource.

## Constraints honored (these bite if you get them wrong)

1. Mime type is exactly `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (no space).
2. postMessage payloads are full JSON-RPC 2.0 shape — `{jsonrpc, id, method, params}`.
3. The iframe sends `ui/initialize` and waits for the result before calling tools.
4. Only `launch_nav_ai` has `_meta.ui.resourceUri`. The other tools are normal.
5. `connectDomains` includes the server's own `BASE_URL` so the iframe can open SSE back to it.
6. `/oauth/authorize` returns HTML with a redirect, not JSON.
7. Shell HTML references `/static/*` via absolute `BASE_URL` so assets resolve inside the host's iframe sandbox.
